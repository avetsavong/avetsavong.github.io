        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Senior majoring in Computer Engineering at the 
            University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br><br>
            I enjoy playing video games in my free time as well as researching 
            more about my interests in mechanical keyboards, audiophile equipment, 
            and etc. My professional interests include real-time computer graphics, 
            parallel computation, and computer architecture. <br><br>
            I hope to be able to apply my studies in a professional field one day in
            the video game industry.
